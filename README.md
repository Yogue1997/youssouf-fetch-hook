<!-- Overview -->

As I was new to coding, I used to write a lot of lines of coding just to fetch apis on every component in order to show the datas.

But as I was growing in this tech world, I realized that speed was one of the important stuff in order to deliver a react app faster.

That's why I created a custom react fetch hook named that could do the job without having the need to write many lines of code just to display the datas.

This is my first experience being exposed to this, but I will be making some progression in order to make my react hook to do the crud operations works. 
As of now, it can only read the data. But some improvement will be made.
